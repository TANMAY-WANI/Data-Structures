## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are essential components of computer science and play a crucial role in solving real-world problems efficiently. This repository serves as a personal workspace for practicing DSA problems, implementing algorithms, and maintaining a record of solutions.

## Repository Structure

- **/Hashing:** This directory contains solutions to problems related to hashing. Each sub-directory corresponds to a specific problem or concept within the hashing domain.

- **/LinkedList:** Solutions to problems related to linked lists are organized in this directory. Each sub-directory focuses on a specific problem or concept within the linked list domain.

Feel free to explore the directories to find problems and solutions categorized by their respective topics.

## Problem Solving

### Guidelines

1. Each problem solution should be well-documented, providing an explanation of the approach, time complexity, and space complexity.

2. Follow a consistent coding style and naming convention to enhance readability.

3. Include relevant comments to explain complex logic or optimizations.

4. If a problem has multiple solutions, consider adding a discussion on the pros and cons of each approach.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to add a solution, improve an existing one, or suggest a new problem, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add your feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request.

Please adhere to the contribution guidelines outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
